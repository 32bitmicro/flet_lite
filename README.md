# flet-lite
flet-lite is a tiny version of flet that not uses subprocess or multiprocessing. Its only uses threads 🪄.

|| **Why flet-lite 🙃?**

When I was trying to use my iPad for programming, I was miss something, which is my favourite UI library [flet](https://flet.dev/)!. Flet is a python library that allow you to code flutter apps in python without using dart or flutter. Everything is perfectly pythonic. Due to iPadOS limitations I was not able to code flet on python for iPad version. Then I came up with an idea of making a tiny version of the library for iPad, so me (and anyone) can use this powerful package just on iPad!!.

|| **What code editor to use 👨‍💻?**

You can use any code editor that support `pip` on mobile or iPad, these are some recommends:
- [Code App](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1512938504): Its a paid app that provide a powerful tools for coding. Also its a vscode like theme. Its include a terminal that support python and `pip`.
- [a-shell](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1473805438): Its a free app that provide a linux-like shell, its include python by default, also supports `pip`.


## installation ⬇️

Using `pip`, enter:
```zsh
pip install flet_lite --upgrade
```
